🧰 Core Tools in Burp Suite
These come built-in with both the Community and Professional versions (though some features are limited in Community).

1. 🔍 Proxy
Intercepts and modifies traffic between your browser and the web server.

Essential for analyzing requests/responses.

2. 📁 Target
Maps and organizes the structure of the application you're testing.

Helps with scoping and planning attacks.

3. 💥 Intruder
Automates attacks like brute force, fuzzing, and parameter testing.

Powerful but slow in the Community edition.

4. 🧪 Repeater
Manually modify and resend HTTP requests.

Useful for testing authentication, CSRF, and logic bugs.

5. 🧫 Scanner (Pro only)
Performs automatic vulnerability scans (e.g., XSS, SQLi, SSRF).

Great for recon and validation.

6. 🧱 Sequencer
Analyzes randomness in tokens (like session IDs).

Useful for testing predictability of cookies or CSRF tokens.

7. 📦 Decoder
Encodes/decodes data (Base64, URL, hex, etc.).

Great for reversing encoded payloads.

8. 🔐 Comparer
Compares two responses, requests, or tokens.

Handy for analyzing changes in application behavior.
